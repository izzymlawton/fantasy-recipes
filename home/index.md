“Perhaps the story in the book is just the lid on a pan: It always stays the same, but underneath there’s a whole world that goes on - developing and changing like our own world.”\
-Inkheart by Cornelia Funke

Food, just like stories, can transport you to an entrie differnt world and range of emotions. I wanted a way for people to be able to transport into the fictional worlds they know and love. From American classics like The Great Gatsby to childhood faviourtes such as Roald Dahl's Matilda. Bake your way into a fanciful fictional world by the use of declious, dreamy and devine food.\
These recipes are perfect for a night of entertaining freinds, family or alone with your favourite book.\
