  Narnia, The Lion, the Witch and The Wardrobe.  C.S. Lewis, Chapter Four

## Ingredients

* 2 cups sugar 
* 2 cups water
* 2 tablespoons lemon juice
* 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
* 2 tablespoons orange flower water
* 2 tablespoons rose water
* 3 drops red food colouring
* 1/2 cup cornstarch 
* 1/2 cup confectioners’ sugar

## Method

1. In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar, water, lemon juice, and cream of tartar. Place the pan over medium-high heat and heat until the mixture comes to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 10 minutes.
2. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the orange flower water, rose water, and red food coloring.
3. In a medium bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and confectioners’ sugar. Slowly add the cornstarch mixture to the saucepan, stirring continuously.
4. Place the pan back over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Continue to cook for 5 minutes, until the mixture has thickened.
