*'I thought it was only a kind of cram, such as the Dalemen made for journeys into the wild,' said the Dwarf*[](http://www.thetolkienwiki.org/wiki.cgi?Dwarf)*.*

*'So it is,' they answered, 'But we call it lembas or way bread, and it is more strengthening than any food made by Men*[](http://www.thetolkienwiki.org/wiki.cgi?Men)*, and it is more pleasant than cram, by all accounts.'*

*'Indeed it is' said Gimli.'*[](http://www.thetolkienwiki.org/wiki.cgi?Gimli)
